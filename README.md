Trying to create a login system where a user is asked if they have an account, if they do have an account, they can login and the program
checks the text files to make sure their credentials are valid. If they do not have an account, they will make a new username and password 
which will be stored in the text files and then they can login. I am currently not finished. I am trying to add a function that will allow
the user to change their password, and I am also trying to make sure when writing the username and password into the text files, it is
is either written as a list or dictionary. If you have any ideas on how to improve it, please feel free to edit the code and contact me
what changes were made with my email ammudahbia@gmail.com.
